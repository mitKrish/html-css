        Shady!
        Konvict!
        Upfront!
        Akon!
        Slim Shady!
        I see the one
        Could she be that lady?

        Hey!
        I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
        Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
        Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-bo
        And possibly bend you over
        Look back and watch me
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that, 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
        
        Upfront style ready to attack now
        Pull in tha parkin' lot slow wit' tha 'Lac down
        Konvict's got tha whole thing packed now
        Step in tha club, the wardrobe intact now
        I feel it down and cracked now
        Ooh, I see a doll at back now!
        I'ma call her, then I put the Mack down
        Money no problem, pocket full of that now!
        I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
        Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
        Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-bo?
        And possibly bend you over?
        Look back and watch me
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that, 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
        
        Oh, looks like another club banger
        They better hang on
        When they throw this thing on
        Get a little drink on
        They gonna flip for this Akon shit
        You can bank on it!
        Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
        The way she climbs up and down them poles
        Looking like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
        Tryin' to hold my woody back through my drawers
        Steps off-stage, didn't think I saw
        Creeps up behind me, and she's like, "Yo!"
        I'm like, "Ya, I know! Let's cut to the chase
        No time to waste, back to my place
        Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
        Or more like a palace, shall I say?
        And plus, I got a pal If your gal is game
        In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin'!"
        (Akon!)
        
        I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
        Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
        Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-bo
        And possibly bend you over
        Look back and watch me
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
       
        Eminem's rollin', D' n' 'em rollin'
        'Bou and all marvelous them rollin'
        And women just hoein', big booty rollin'
        Soon I'll be all in them and throwin' D
        Hittin' no less than three
        Block wheel style like, "Whee!"
        Girl, I can tell you want me 'cause lately
        I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
        Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
        Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-bo
        And possibly bend you over
        Look back and watch me
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
        Smack that all on the floor
        Smack that, give me some more
        Smack that 'til you get sore
        Smack that, oh-oh
